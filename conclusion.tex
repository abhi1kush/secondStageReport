\chapter{Conclusion \& Future work}
\label{ch:conclusion}
We have implemented various algorithms for constraint generation for capturing information flow in program, category 4 algorithm represents intuitive notion of correct security. Second part is verification of constraints using RWFM \cite{rwfm} is also implemented. We considered the subject in information flow analysis, it helps to deal with real world problems related with information flow.\\
\textbf{Future work}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Information flow analysis on python data structures list, dictionary etc.
	\item Information flow analysis related to dynamic types and objects in python
	\item Implementation for all features of python.  
\end{itemize}
