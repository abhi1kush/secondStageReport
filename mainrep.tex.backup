\begin{abstract}
	\par With the increasing number of users and gadgets, the mobile network operators are facing difficulties in scaling their radio and core network appliances. This has made them to think of re-designing the existing mobile network architecture, especially the LTE core network or the EPC (Evolved Packet Core). Various ideas have been proposed by researchers across the globe to transform the EPC in order to overcome the issues being faced by the mobile operators. Software Defined Networking (SDN) is one such trend that aims to enhance service flexibility and scalability, while lowering the total cost. The SDN-based approach separates out the control and data planes from the EPC components. The control functions run as applications on top of a controller whereas the data plane is comprised of general purpose OpenFlow switches. Thus, we have a low-cost packet gateways in the data plane, whereas flexible network functions in the control plane. Although there have been several proposals to re-design the EPC, but there does not exist any open-source framework to compare and analyse different design choices on the basis of performance metrics.
	\par In this thesis, we present the design and implementation of an open-source LTE EPC based on the paradigms of SDN. We have evaluated the SDN-based EPC for various LTE procedures and provided a benchmarking on essential network performance parameters. Our framework can be used for research and experimentation, and to perform a comparative study of EPC re-design aspects such as Network Functions Virtualization (NFV). Besides, it can be used to develop new functionalities based on future LTE standards.
