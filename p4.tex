\chapter{Category 4 constraints: PC monotonic and dynamic label.}
\label{ch:c4}
This algorithm is best among all four algorithm in terms information security. Dynamic label processing increases time complexity of this algorithm but we used a property of PC label to make optimization.
Constraint generation rules are same as category 3.
\section{Key Idea} In this analysis PC never gets reset because we want to track all possible information flows including information flows from a nonterminating loop to rest of code.\\ 
'a' is a local var\\
a = x\\
while w:\\
\hspace*{1cm} y = a\\
\hspace*{1cm} a = z\\
z = y\\~\\
Dynamic label Analysis:\\
1. $\lambda(a) = x$\\
2.PC\{w\}\\
3.PC\{w, $\lambda$(a)\{x\}\} \hspace{1cm} $w\oplus x \le y$\\
4.$\lambda(a) = z$\\
5.PC\{w, x, y\} \hspace{1cm} $w\oplus x\oplus y \le z$\\

So this algorithm is capable to track information flow w\marr z in last statement z = y by using monotonic PC without generating additional false constraints. 
\section{Limitations}
Use of dynamic label with monotonic creates challenge for processing of large number of labels.
